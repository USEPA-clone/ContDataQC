<h1>About ContDataQC</h1>
<p>The ContDataQC Shiny app is a free R-based tool that was developed to
help water quality monitoring programs quality control (QC), merge and
summarize continuous sensor data files in a standardized, more efficient
way. It also has a function that allows users to download U.S.
Geological Survey gage data at sites and over periods of their choosing.
This Shiny app is linked to the ContDataQC R package, which was
developed for EPA by Tetra Tech in support of the EPA and is available
on

Website</span> </span> </a>.</p>
<p>The ContDataQC R package and Shiny app were developed with the
following objectives in mind: ensure that a certain (minimum) level of
QC is being performed on continuous data files; standardize and speed up
data QC and reduce missed errors; and standardize data for further
analysis and sharing. ContDataQC is currently configured for
temperature, water level, discharge, conductivity, dissolved oxygen
(DO), pH, turbidity, chlorophyll-a and salinity data. Users with
advanced R skills can add any other parameters that they desire by
making edits to the configuration file, which can be viewed in R or in
Notepad.</p>

<h1>Funding</h1>
<p>Development of the ContDataQC R Shiny app has been funded by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research
and Development (ORD) as part of a larger project to establish Regional
Monitoring Networks (RMNs) for freshwater streams and inland lakes. The
RMNs are a volunteer, collaborative effort in which entities collect
long-term continuous temperature and hydrologic data at targeted sites
to detect changes over time. For more information on the RMNs, please
refer to the

Monitoring Networks (RMN) to Detect Changing Baselines in Freshwater
Wadeable Streams (Final Report)</a>.</p>
