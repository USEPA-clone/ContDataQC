<h3>Aggregate Output</h3>

<p>Instructions for generating aggregated reports using the ContDataQC
Shiny app:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the QC’d input files that
you’d like to combine. The input files need to be from the same site and
share common parameters. The status bar will tell you when the upload is
complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Select ‘Aggregate QC’d data’ from the ‘Choose operation to
perform’ drop-down menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the ‘Run operation’ button that appears. A status bar will
appear in the lower right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>After the function is done running, click the ‘Download’ button
that appears. You will be prompted to save a zipped file named
‘Aggregate.date_time.’ Save it in the Data3_Aggregated folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Unzip/extract the file(s). After file is unzipped, a new folder
called ‘data’ will appear. If a ‘data’ folder already exists, outputs
will go into that folder. The aggregate reports have ‘DATA_’ as the
prefix in the file name. The original zipped file can be deleted if
desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Open and review the aggregated reports. As with the QC output,
there are two types of outputs: a Word document Data Quality Control
Report and a comma-delimited (.csv) spreadsheet. If users prefer a
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) report instead of Word, they can change
the format in the configuration file (this requires some familiarity
with R code).</p></li>
</ol>
