<h1>Automated Reformatting</h1>
<p>These functions convert files coming directly from sensors or
proprietary sensor software like HOBOware into a format that is ready to
run through the QC report function (<strong>Main Functions &gt;&gt; Run
Functions &gt;&gt; QC raw data (from drop-down menu)</strong>). This
saves you time and eliminates errors that sometimes occur when manually
reformatting files.</p>
<p>Currently, reformatting functions are available for two types of
sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Onset HOBO (currently water level (U20), temperature (pro V2 and
Pendant), and DO (U26))</p></li>
<li><p>miniDOT DO</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Reformatting functions for other types of sensors can be added in the
future, if requested.</p>
