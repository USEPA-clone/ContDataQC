<h1>Workflow</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Select QC flag test thresholds.</strong> Use the default
thresholds (<strong>Main Functions &gt;&gt; QC Thresholds &gt;&gt;
Default</strong> tab) or upload a customized configuration file
(<strong>Main Functions &gt;&gt; QC Thresholds &gt;&gt; Upload Custom
Thresholds</strong> tab). If you have one or more years of continuous
data for a site, we encourage you to evaluate the performance of the QC
test thresholds for each parameter at that site and customize the
configuration file if needed. Click <strong>Main Functions &gt;&gt; QC
Thresholds &gt;&gt; Evaluate Thresholds</strong> tab for tips on
evaluating thresholds. To learn how to edit thresholds, click
<strong>Main Functions &gt;&gt; QC Thresholds &gt;&gt; Edit
Thresholds</strong> tab.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check the configuration file name.</strong> Make sure the
correct configuration file has been uploaded prior to running the QC
reports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upload the desired input file(s).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run the ‘QC raw data’</strong> function to generate QC
reports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>After the data file(s) are QC’d, users can run them
through the Aggregate function</strong> to merge them with other files.
The input files need to be from the same site and share common
parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The user can run the aggregated file through the Summary
Statistics function</strong> to generate CSV files with an assortment of
summary statistics (e.g., min, median, max, quartiles) and a PDF with
time series plots for each parameter.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After running each function, users must unzip/extract the files or
the files won’t be seen as an option to upload for the next step. After
files are unzipped, new folders will automatically appear and the
original zipped files can be deleted if desired.</p>
<p>Time-saver tip: some internet browsers, like Google Chrome and
Mozilla Firefox, allow users to change settings so that users can select
which folder to download files to (versus files going to the default
Download folder).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mozilla Firefox: go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Files and
Applications &gt; Check box for “always ask where to save
files.”</p></li>

<p>Some users may prefer to use the R code instead of the Shiny app. For
more information, see the ‘About - Advanced’ tab</p>
